# Basic (Initial) statistical Inference
In these two mini projects I have tried to carry out some basic statistical inference technique to get some desired result

1.)In first project or report ,it is a kind of simulation exercise to investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with 
   CLT(Central Limit Theorm).
   
2.)In second project ,I tried to investigate ToothGrowth data
